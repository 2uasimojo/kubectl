# Demo: hello world with instances

Goal:

 1. Clone a simple off-the-shelf example as a base configuration.
 1. Customize it.
 1. Create two different instances based on the customization.

First define a place to work:

<!-- @makeWorkplace @test -->
```
DEMO_HOME=$(mktemp -d)
```

Alternatively, use

> ```
> DEMO_HOME=~/hello
> ```
